## Vultr Automation Script

Instead of using Terraform(which does have a Vultr provider module), I thought it would a good idea to reinvent the wheel. Do not do that - this was done for learning and shenanigans.

Sphinx documentation can be found here : https://laurentdumont.github.io/vultr-automation/index.html

Have fun!
